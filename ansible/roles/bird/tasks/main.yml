# Since we configure BIRD to install blackhole default routes as
# backstops, we need to ensure that it can connect out (and install any
# default routes that it receives) as soon as it's started below.
# Otherwise, we may lose our connection to the host. Therefore, we need
# to apply changes to the firewall *first*.
